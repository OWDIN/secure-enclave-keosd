Run Hardware-based EOS wallet with your Macbook Pro Touch ID.

## Overview
The Secure Enclave is a hardware-based key manager thatâ€™s isolated from the main processor to provide an extra layer of security. When you store a private key in the Secure Enclave, you never actually handle the key, making it difficult for the key to become compromised. Instead, you instruct the Secure Enclave to create the key, securely store it, and perform operations with it. You receive only the output of these operations, such as encrypted data or a cryptographic signature verification outcome.
